# Outline
A more detailed description can be found on the wiki-page.
The basic idea is to create a versatile random generator for the terminal.

## Supported commands:
```
-h ... Print help text
-r a b ... choose a random number in range (a, b) (a,b inclusive)
-s... create a random string
-s f ... create a random string with flags. f can be a combination from s=special character, n=numbers, u=upper case l=lower case
-l k ... result should have k character/digits
```

### Example
Create a random string containing numbers and upper-case letters.
```
./rand -s nu -l 20
> 3SB9JBIPAW24M46AXS9P
```

Choose a random number between 0 and 9999 with 2 digits
```
./rand -r 0 9999 -l 2
> 63
```

Choose a random item from a list
```
./rand -c Alice Bob Tom
> Tom
```
